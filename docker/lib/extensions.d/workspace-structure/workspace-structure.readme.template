# Sindri Workspace

## Directory Structure (Multi-Project Design)

- `projects/` - Project storage root
  - `active/` - Active development projects (each project has its own src/, tests/, docs/)
- `scripts/` - Workspace-wide utility and management scripts
  - `lib/` - Shared script libraries and extension manager
  - `extensions.d/` - Extension scripts
- `config/` - Workspace-wide configuration files
  - `templates/` - Configuration templates
- `agents/` - Agent configurations and data
- `context/` - Context management for Claude Code
  - `global/` - Global context files
  - `templates/` - Context templates
- `bin/` - Workspace-wide executable binaries and tool symlinks
- `backups/` - Backup files
- `docs/` - Workspace-wide documentation
  - `getting-started.md` - Onboarding guide
  - `extensions-guide.md` - Extension system reference

## Multi-Project Workflow

Individual projects are created in `/workspace/projects/active/` using:

```bash
# Create new project
new-project my-app --type node

# Clone existing project
clone-project https://github.com/user/repo
```

Each project has its own structure with `src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, etc.

## Usage

This workspace is managed by Sindri's extension system. Use `extension-manager` to
activate, install, and manage components.

For more information, see the main project README.
